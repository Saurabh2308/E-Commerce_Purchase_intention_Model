# E-Commerce_Purchase_intention_Model
Introduction:

The code performs sentiment analysis using an RNN with LSTM cells to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of text data.
Dataset Description:

The IMDB movie review dataset is used, which contains movie reviews labeled with sentiment.
Data preprocessing involves tokenization and padding of sequences.
Dependencies:

TensorFlow and NumPy are required for deep learning and numerical operations, respectively.
Configuration:

max_features determines the number of most frequent words to consider.
maxlen sets the maximum sequence length for input data.
Load Dataset:

The IMDB dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in function, splitting it into training and testing sets.
Data Preprocessing:

Sequences are padded to ensure uniform length for input into the neural network.
Model Architecture:

An embedding layer converts input tokens into dense vectors.
An LSTM layer processes the sequences and captures temporal dependencies.
A dense layer with sigmoid activation produces binary sentiment predictions.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Training:

The model is trained on the training data with a specified number of epochs and batch size.
Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test data to measure its performance.
Test accuracy is printed to assess the model's effectiveness.
By breaking down the code and filling in each activity, we create a clear and informative explanation of the sentiment analysis task and the corresponding implementation using deep learning techniques.
